# The Scarlet Rot

A parasitic disease that consumes the Lands Between. 

It is most heavily concentrated in **Caelid**, following the catastrophic battle between *Malenia, Blade of Miquella*, and *Starscourge Radahn*. Once unleashed, the rot blooms and fundamentally alters the local flora, fauna, and geography into a nightmare landscape.
